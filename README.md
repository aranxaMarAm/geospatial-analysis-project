# Spatial Modeling of Armed Conflict in Colombia (2022)

## üìç Project Overview

This project investigates the spatial dynamics of armed conflict in Colombia by modeling municipal-level conflict intensity using spatial econometric techniques. Drawing on 2022 geospatial data and socio-economic indicators‚Äîsuch as GDP per capita, coca cultivation, fiscal performance, and forced displacement‚Äîthe analysis reveals that conflict is not randomly distributed but spatially clustered, reflecting deeper structural conditions. By applying models that account for spatial spillover effects (SLX, SAR, and SEM), the project demonstrates that local development factors influence not only a municipality‚Äôs exposure to violence but also that of its neighbors. The findings provide insights into how geographically-informed policies could better address the persistence of violence in post-conflict settings.
